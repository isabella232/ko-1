## Manual Integration For iOS
Drag and drop the following frameworks from the __plugins/ios__ folder of the `ValuePotion` bundle into your Xcode project, check `Copy items if needed` when adding frameworks:

> sdkbox.framework

> PluginValuePotion.framework

The above frameworks depend upon other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:

> UIKit.framework

> Foundation.framework

> CoreGraphics.framework

> SystemConfiguration.framework

> CoreTelephony.framework

> AdSupport.framework
