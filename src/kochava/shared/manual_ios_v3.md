## Manual Integration For iOS
Drag and drop the following frameworks from the __plugins/ios__ folder of the `Kochava` bundle into your Xcode project, check `Copy items if needed` when adding frameworks:

> sdkbox.framework

> PluginKochava.framework

The above frameworks depend upon a number of other frameworks. You also need
to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:

> Security.framework

> SystemConfiguration.framework

> UIKit.framework

> Foundation.framework

> AdSupport.framework

> iAd.framework

> CoreLocation.framework
