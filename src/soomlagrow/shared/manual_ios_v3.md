## Manual Integration For iOS
Drag and drop the following frameworks from the __plugins/ios__ folder of the `SOOMLA Grow` bundle into your Xcode project, check `Copy items if needed` when adding frameworks:

> sdkbox.framework

> PluginSoomlaGrow.framework

The above frameworks depend upon a large number of other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:

> Security.framework

> libsqlite3.0.dylib

> StoreKit.framework

> CFNetwork.framework

> libicucore.dylib

> SystemConfguration.framework

> AdSupport.framework
