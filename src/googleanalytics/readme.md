<!--## Configuration
<<[../../shared/sdkbox_cloud.md]
<<[../../shared/remote_application_config.md]-->

### JSON Configuration
SDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your `res/sdkbox_config.json`, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app

Here is an example of the Google Analytics configuration, you need to replace `<TRACKING_CODE>`  with your specific [__Google Analytics Tracking Code__](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) account information.
```json
"GoogleAnalytics" : {
    "trackingCode" : "<TRACKING_CODE>"
}
```

## Notice

* If your account is new, it might take up to 24 hours to show tracking data.

* Once you see some historical activity on the tracker, you can see realtime data as well.
