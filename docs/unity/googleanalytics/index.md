##Importing SDKBOX GoogleAnalytics

First import the ```sdkbox_googleanalytics``` unity package into your project. This will create a directory SDKBOX under Assets. If you have other SDKBOX plugins installed, they will appear here too. A plugins directory may also be present if you have other SDKBOX plugins. This directory contains files for iOS and Android.


##Using the GoogleAnalytics Plugin

To begin using GoogleAnalytics plugin, find the GoogleAnalytics prefab in the Assets/SDKBOX/googleanalytics directory.

Drag an instance of this prefab into the scene where you want to start using analytics. You should only have a single instance of this prefab at any time.

The analytics session is being explicitly started at plugin initialization time.

public static void startSession();
```

<h6>
You normally will never stop a session manually. But if you need to, you can call this manually.
</h6>
```
static void stopSession();
```

<h6>
Manually request dispatch of hits. By default, data is dispatched from the Google Analytics SDK for Android every 5 minutes.
</h6>
```
static void dispatchHits();
```

<h6>
Change the dispatch info time period to the desired amount of seconds.
</h6>
```
static void dispatchPeriodically(int seconds);
```

<h6>
Stop periodically sending info. Then manually the <code>dispatchPeridically</code>
or <code>dispatchHits</code> should be called.
</h6>
```
static void stopPeriodicalDispatch();
```

<h6>
Set user ID for this tracking session.
</h6>
```
static void setUser(string userID);
```

<h6>
Set value for custom dimension.
</h6>
```
static void setDimension(int index, string value);
```

<h6>
Set value for custom metric.

```
static void setMetric(int index, string value);
