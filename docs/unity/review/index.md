For more information, visit our website @ [www.sdkbox.com](http://cocos2d-x.org/sdkbox)

**<h2>Important. Users of SDKBOX IAP pre-v1.3.7</h2>**

If you have used and installed SDKBOX IAP v1.3.6 or earlier, you must either update to IAP 1.3.7 or delete the Assets/IAP directory, before adding other SDKBOX plugins.

##Importing SDKBOX Review

First import the ```sdkbox_review``` unity package into your project. This will create two directories in Assets, one for review and one for SDKBOX. If you have other SDKBOX plugins installed, they will appear here too. A plugins directory will also be present if you have other SDKBOX plugins. This directory contains files for iOS and Android.

To begin using Review, find the Review prefab in the Assets/SDKBOX/review directory.

Create an instance of the Review prefab in the scene where you want to use the Review package. You should only have a single instance of this prefab at any time.

Select the Review game object in the hierarchy and in your inspector pane you can configure the object to customize the Review dialog.

##Additional iOS Instructions
On some older versions of Unity, the static libraries in Review/Assets/Plugins/iOS do not get included in the Xcode project. In this case they need to be moved to Assets/Plugins/iOS or added to the Xcode project manually.
